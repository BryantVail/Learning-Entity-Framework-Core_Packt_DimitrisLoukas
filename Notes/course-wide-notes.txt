EnvironmentVariable at the command-line
    At the command line

    You can easily set an environment variable from a command prompt using the setx.exe command included in Windows since Vista. You can use it to easily set a user variable:

    >setx ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT "Development"

    SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.

    Note that the environment variable is not set in the current open window. You will need to open a new command prompt to see the updated environment. It is also possible to set system variables (rather than just user variables) if you open an administrative command prompt and add the /M switch:

    >setx ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT "Development" /M

    SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.

    Code: 
        C:\Users\bvail\Documents\GitHub\Learning-Entity-Framework-Core_Packt_DimitrisLoukas\course-code\Code\Section 3\BookStoreApp\BookStoreApp
        >setx ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT "Development" /M
